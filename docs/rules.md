# Rules
## Core Rules
### Ability Scores
Each player character (PC) has three **ability scores**.
- **Strength (STR)** - Used for saves requiring power, endurance, resisting poison, etc.
- **Dexterity (DEX)** - Used for saves requiring grace, finesse, dodging, etc.
- **Luck (LCK)** - Used for saves requiring gambling, not getting shot, fate, etc.

### Saves
When the PC is doing something risky where success of an action is uncertain, a player rolls a d20. If you roll equal to or under the relevant ability score, you succeed and suffer no consequences. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure. Failure does not always mean that the action failed, but instead that some sort of consequence has happened.

The Judge can also ask a player to make a save to determine if a PC is able to resist an effect or react quickly enough to avoid harm.

In an opposed situation, whoever is most at risk must save. Whenever two or more characters are doing something together, whoever is most at risk must save. This is normally the character with the lowest ability score.
### Rest & Healing

### Fatigue & Deprivation
Each point of **fatigue** occupies 1 inventory slot. You may gain fatigue when deprived, when using certain items, due to an enemy's action, or because of something else in the fiction.
