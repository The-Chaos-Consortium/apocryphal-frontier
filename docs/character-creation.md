# Character Creation
## Ability Scores
Each player character (PC) has three ability scores.
- Strength (STR) - Power, endurance, resisting poison, etc.
- Dexterity (DEX) - Grace, finesse, dodging, etc.
- Luck (LCK) - Gambling, not getting shot, fate, etc.

For each of these **roll 3d6** to determine each of your PCâ€™s ability scores. This will give a range of **3 to 18** for each ability score, with **10** being average. You may swap any two of the results.
## Grit
Each PC starts with **1d6 Grit**, a measure of your ability to avoid life-threatening harm. This is not health or fortitude, and it is not lost for long.

If an attack takes you to exactly 0 Grit, you must roll on the **Scars** table.
## Inventory
Every character has a total of 10 **inventory slots**. Without a bag of some sort, a character can only carry four items at once.

Each PC starts with a **satchel** that can hold six slots of items. Horses and mules should be used with saddlebags to carry more items. **Lackeys** can also be hired to carry items.

Inventory is abstract, and the Judge adjudicates if something can be treated as abstractable to an item slot, or if it is too large and must be engaged within the fiction, like a lockbox or a vault. Anyone who has a full inventory (i.e. 10 slots) is reduced to 0 Grit. No character can have more than 10 inventory slots.
### Inventory Slots
- Most items take up one slot unless otherwise specified.
- **Petty** items do not take up any slots.
- **Bulky** items take up two slots.

## Past Career & Belongings
Every character has a **past career** that determines their starting equipment and funds. For one reason or another, they have left their past behind and are now on the frontier. Will you fall back on your past life, or make a name for yourself?

Either roll a **d20** to randomly [determine a past career](past-careers.md), or pick a specific one from the available options.
## Name, Age, & Traits
Name your character. Pick an age no younger than 18, or roll 3d10 + 16 for a random age. Choose a sex for your PC.

Create or roll the rest of your PC's traits, such as their physique, face, skin, hair, clothing, virtue, vice, speech, and misfortune, using the following tables.
